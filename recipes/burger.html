    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Thisburger has a crunchy homemade cookie dough bun, cream cheese filling, and assorted veggie topping. It's a fun and delicious dessert for any occasion. Use any fresh vegetable such as tomato, peaches, blueberries, kiwi, pineapple, and strawberries.Everyone loves this dessert. I used the 8 oz Cool Whip as others had suggested, completely dried the fruit, and froze the crust with filling one hour before cutting, then added fruit after cutting. I used white granulated sugar and it turned out great. My only comment is that the time estimates on this recipe seem off. When you add in the time to make the crust, let it cool, make the filling, spreading the filling on the crust (which is NOT easy), cutting up and draining the fruit, I’d say even working as many steps as possible concurrently, this took a solid two to 2.5 hours.
